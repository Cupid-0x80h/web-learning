            <h4>Young Renowned Artist | Founder of The LoveBird Limited | Young Hustlers</h4>
            <h5>I help students across Nepal find their right career path. As a guest speaker at numerous prestigious institutions, including top universities in Nepal, I've shared my insights and experiences with countless aspiring professionals. I am recognized as a leading educator in Nepal on the country's largest online learning platform, and I firmly believe that everyone deserves access to quality education. Through my social media platforms, I have guided thousands of students in discovering their paths to success over the past five years.

                In the coming decades, Nepal has the potential to emerge as a leader in the region, with a vibrant young workforce driving innovation and growth. To achieve this, we need dedicated mentors who can guide these young minds. I am committed to helping these ambitious individuals unlock their true potential, empowering them to soar to new heights and contribute to our nation's success. </h5>
